# Performance, Profiling, and Debugging Plans

## Profiling options
**EventSource + `dotnet-trace` / PerfView**: `TerrainPerformanceEventSource` now emits begin/end events for `ChunkedTilemap.UpdateActiveChunks`, `LoadChunk`, `SaveChunk`, and `WaveFunctionCollapse` (see the `UpdateActiveChunksBegin/End`, `ChunkLoadBegin/End`, `ChunkSaveBegin/End`, and `WaveFunctionCollapseBegin/End` payloads). `dotnet-trace` can capture those events and timeline views; pair with `dotnet-counters` to monitor the process-level CPU/GC/ThreadPool counters while scrolling manually. Because `EventSource` produces structured events, filter by the `EventName` and see durations in the TraceViewer, making it easy to spot chunk-save spikes.

**.NET Counters**: The same `TerrainPerformanceEventSource` exposes `EventCounter` metrics `active-chunk-count` and `chunks-saved-per-second` in addition to the built-in CPU/memory counters. `dotnet-counters monitor --process-id <pid>` can display those alongside CPU/memory, letting us correlate UI hitches with chunk load/save bursts, and the counters stream into `dotnet-trace` for later flame graph analysis.

**Tracy integration**: For frame-level profiling inside the MonoGame render loop, wrap `ChunkedTilemap` entry points with Tracy `Zone` macros (requires adding the Tracy C# bindings or using a thin native agent). Tracy captures per-frame timelines, allows zooming on slow frames, and can be toggled on/off via command-line or config. Document this integration so new builds can enable Tracy only when needed, keeping regular builds lean.

- ### Sample commands
+ `dotnet-counters ps` to enumerate running `.NET` processes and grab the PID for TerrainGeneration2D. The `dotnet-counters list` subcommand no longer reports per-process counters—it just prints the documentation link shown above—so rely on `ps` + `monitor` instead.
+ `dotnet-counters monitor --process-id <pid> --refresh-interval 1 --counters "JohnLudlow.TerrainGeneration2D.Performance-active-chunk-count" "JohnLudlow.TerrainGeneration2D.Performance-chunks-saved-per-second" "System.Runtime-cpu-usage" "System.Runtime-working-set"` will sample those counters each second; the CLI shows the pause/resume/quit instructions right away and then prints updated values on each refresh tick, so keep it running to see the custom counters appear once `ChunkedTilemap.UpdateActiveChunks` runs and `ReportActiveChunkCount` fires.
+ `dotnet-trace collect --process-id <pid> --providers "JohnLudlow.TerrainGeneration2D.Performance::Informational" --format nettrace --output terrain-events.nettrace` captures all events emitted by `TerrainPerformanceEventSource`; open the resulting trace in PerfView (or `dotnet-trace convert terrain-events.nettrace --format speedscope`) to inspect `ChunkLoadBegin/End`, `ChunkSaveBegin/End`, and `UpdateActiveChunks` durations.
+ After the trace completes, run `dotnet-trace ps` (or the task manager) to verify the process ID and reopen the trace if needed; you can also replay the timeline with `perfview /trace:terrain-events.nettrace` or `speedscope terrain-events.speedscope.json` if you convert the file.

## Benchmark extension
- The new benchmark `GenerateAndScrollChunks` in `TerrainGeneration2D.Benchmarks/Program.cs` seeds a map, fills the 2×2-chunk viewport, then simulates eight scrolling steps by shifting the viewport by one chunk each time before saving everything. This mimics the runtime work done while the camera pans and exercises both chunk generation and the repeated `UpdateActiveChunks`/save logic.

## Debugging overlay plan
- Build a Gum/MonoGame overlay that draws current chunk bounds using `ChunkedTilemap.TileToChunkCoordinates` + `Chunk.ChunkSize`. White lines can highlight the 3×3 buffered area and the currently rendered viewport. Maintain a boolean `ShowDebugBounds` in `GameScene` that toggles when F12 is pressed (listen in `Update()` once per frame). When enabled, draw the overlay after chunk rendering (e.g., using `SpriteBatch.DrawRectangle` helpers or a simple pixel texture). Add tooltips showing chunk coordinates and whether they are loaded or pending save.
- Tie the overlay toggle to `GameController` (new `IsDebugOverlayActive()` method) so input handling stays centralized. Persist the state in `GameSceneUI` if you want to display the status in the Gum tree (e.g., a corner label that says "Debug Bounds: ON/OFF"). This UI helps confirm which chunks are active and if chunk saves are blocking scrolls.

## Terrain parameter tuning UI plan
- Extend `GameSceneUI` (or create a dedicated Gum panel) with sliders/dropdowns for `TerrainRuleConfiguration` and `HeightMapConfiguration` values: ocean/plains/mountain height thresholds, `MountainNoiseThreshold`, and the `HeightMapConfiguration` scales/weights. Each slider change writes back to a live `TerrainRuleConfiguration` instance that the current `ChunkedTilemap` references (or triggers a scene reload). Because the tilemap regenerates from saved chunk files, offer a "Regenerate" button that deletes `Content/saves` and rebuilds the visible chunks at the current camera position.
- For instant feedback during play, allow the UI to create a new `ChunkedTilemap` with the updated config upon button press, and swap it into `GameScene` (dispose the old tilemap, `SaveAll`, then instantiate a fresh one). Keep the UI out of the critical render path by executing the rebuild on a background task or frame queue, showing a busy indicator until the new chunks are ready.
- Document the UI controls (slider ranges, units) near the debugging overlay so testers know how to dial up ocean vs. mountain coverage without touching code.
